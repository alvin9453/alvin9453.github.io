2017/11/13 - Named Data Networking (NDN) installation guide - part 2
=============================================================================

Introduction
--------------

In this installation guide, I will demostrate how to install *ndnfs-port* and use ``fetch-media.html`` in **NDN-JS**.

My Platform
--------------

Ubuntu 16.04.2 Server (64-bit)

NDNFS installation [#]_
---------------------------

Overview
```````````````

NDNFS: NDN-friendly file system (based on FUSE)

Install ndn-cpp [#]_
``````````````````````

Before installing NDNFS, we have to install **ndn-cpp** first.

::
    
    git clone https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp.git && cd ndn-cpp
    git reset --hard 52152710bc7f12cbe22376b414bb5c05923f4d99    // release v1.0 (The latest version will fail to build.)
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install clean
    sudo /sbin/ldconfig

Requirements
````````````````

::

    sudo apt-get install fuse libfuse-dev pkg-config sqlite3 libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libboost-all-dev libsqlite3-dev


Download from github and build NDNFS
```````````````````````````````````````````

::
    
    git clone https://github.com/remap/ndnfs-port.git && cd ndnfs-port
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig 
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
    ./waf configure --boost-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
    ./waf

Configure NDNFS
`````````````````````````````

Create two folder : One is the actual folder(dir), and the other one is the mount point folder(ndnfs).

::

    mkdir /tmp/ndnfs
    mkdir /tmp/dir
    cd ndnfs-port
    ./build/ndnfs -s /tmp/dir /tmp/ndnfs

We have to put our files in the mount folder (/tmp/ndnfs). If someone puts files in actual folder and then mount this folder, we can not access the file via NDNJS fetch-media.js.(I think this is a bug.)

Then open NDNFS with a name by option ``-p``
::

     ./ndnfs-port/build/ndnfs-server -p /ndn/tw/edu/ncnu/csie/jarvis/weeklyreport &


Test on NDN-JS fetch-media.html
------------------------------------

Requirements
```````````````

To test on NDN-JS, we also need **NFD** and **NDN-JS**. Please read  `installation guide - part 1 <20170803.html>`_ to install **NFD**.

And we don't need to install **NDN-JS** because it just some JavaScript library, we can use them directly.
::

    git clone https://github.com/named-data/ndn-js.git && cd ndn-js
    git reset --hard 28012475e98cd769b23013f99b4d07cd329b7663

Make sure the Apache (Web Service) is open, this example have to use this machine as an Web Server.


Open browser to test 
`````````````````````

User browser to access your NDN-JS file (e.g.  http://<your_ndn_machine_ip_address>/ndn-js/examples/browser/fetch-media.html ).

Then you will see the fetch-media page, just replace the name and ip address, press connect button.

And you will see like this below :
