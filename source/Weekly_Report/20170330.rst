Existing adaptation approaches for video multicast (cont.)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Agent-based adaptation
```````````````````````

Deploy several agents in a large-scale network, and the agents partition the network into several confined regions, and each agent can thus handle the requirements more easily from its local region.

In figure (a) , an active node (such as a video gateway or agent) offers a richer set of services for video transmission at the application level than figure (b).

Support for video coding techniques
------------------------------------

Discrete cosine transform (DCT [#]_) :  A finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. => Related to lossy compression of audio (e.g. MP3) and images (e.g. JPEG)

Variable bit rate (VBR) and Constant bit rate(CBR) [#]_ : Both terms are used to describe QoS.

Transcoding
````````````

A transcoder converts an existing video stream into a new stream with a different format or rate.

Scalable coding
`````````````````

Intraframe coding(I-frame),preditive coding(P-fram),and bidirectional predictive coding(B-frame). [#]_ => In video compression.

For a spacific enhancement layer, we have only one choice, either to enhance the temporal resolution (time->speed) and spatial resolution (space->quality).

Conclusions
------------

- Simulcast remains a promising approach to address user heterogeneity.=> It's supported in many commercial streaming systems.

- Layered multicast has seldom been used.

- The process of decompression and lossy recompression inherently accumulates quantization noise each time.

- Since Inhternet protocol multicast hasn't been widely deployed, the CDN [#]_ provides a very attractive alternative that's readily available for the current Internet.
