2017/08/31 - NDN-JS Usages
=============================

Introduction
--------------

NDN-JS [#]_ is the first native version of the NDN protocol written in JavaScript. It implements the NDN-TLV wire format.

The primary goal of NDN-JS is to provide a pure Javascript implementation of the NDN API that enables developers to create browser-based or Node.js-based applications using Named Data Networking. 

In this document, I will show how to use **NDN-JS JavaScript API** to ping my ``ndnpingserver``.


Preparation
--------------

Clone the NDN-JS from github :

::

    git clone https://github.com/named-data/ndn-js.git

And I just use JavaScript API, so I can include the library from websites and **do not have to install anything**.

    - https://cdn.rawgit.com/named-data/ndn-js/master/build/ndn.js
    - https://cdn.rawgit.com/named-data/ndn-js/master/build/ndn.min.js

NDNPING by JavaScript API
--------------------------

Now, change directory to the ndnping example that just cloned from githug :

::

    cd ndn-js/examples/ndnping

Then edit ``ndn-ping.js``.

Replace

::

    var hostip = "spurs.cs.ucla.edu";

with

::

    var hostip = "<your_pingserver_ip_address>";

And find the ``dopings()`` funtion, write the pingserver name here.
::

    function dopings() {
        ping("/ndn/tw/edu/ncnu/csie/jarvis");
    }


Then edit ``ndn-ping.html``.

Replace

::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="../../build/ndn.js"></script>

with

::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/named-data/ndn-js/master/build/ndn.js"></script>

Now, open the ``ndn-ping.html`` in browser. The ping message would show like this :

Summary
--------

NDN-JS provides JavaScript API to implement the NDN-TLV wire format. This means I can use JavaScipt to develop web application over NDN.

There are many examples in NDN-JS that I clone from github, and ``ndnping`` is just one of them. I am trying the examples of producer and consumer. So that I can use web to register my name, publish the content and send interest to get the content on web!
