=====================

Feature
-------

- Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.
- Based on *reStructuredText*.
- Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text.

Installation
------------

Install on Linux , `Tutorial and all concepts in this page is from here.
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.8/tutorial.html>`_

Getting Start
-------------

- Using command::

    $ sphinx-quickstart

to set up a source directory and creates a default *conf.py* with the most useful configuration values from a few questions it asks you. Just run.


- toctree 

::

    .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2
     :glob:
        
     ./tmp/glob
    
Note
    *maxdepth* means it will show at most 2 layers, *glob* can make your link to another .rst file ( in this example, the file is ./tmp/glob.rst ).

Running the build
-----------------
sphinx-quickstart script creates a Makefile and a make.bat which make life even easier for you: with them you only need to run

::
    
    make html

to build HTML docs in the build directory you chose. Execute make without an argument to see which targets are available.
