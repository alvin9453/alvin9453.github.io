2017/03/02 -  Nodejs -> Express-generator, Express , MogoDB , Session , and Jade
=================================================================================

Express-generator
------------------

Express-generator can build a web project quickly.

::

  $npm install express-generator

Then we can use *express* to build a project.

  $express Note-taking-system

Express [#]_
-------------

**Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework** that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.

Features:

  1. Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.

  2. Defines a **routing table** which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.

  3. Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.


MongoDB
----------

NoSQL database.

Store data in JSON format.

In Node.js, we need **mongoose** module to access MongoDB.

Session [#]_
-------------

Two type of session : (Database) Session and Cookie-based Session.

Database Session :

  - Store their data server side.

  - One of your web servers handles the first request, other web servers in your cluster will not have the stored information.

  - Data doesn't have to travel from client to server on each request (clients just need to send an ID and the data is loaded from the local file).

  - Can be any size.


Cookie-based Session :

  - Store their data on the client/user end

  - Work smoothly when you have a cluster of web servers.

  - Cookies can be set to a long lifespan, which means that data stored in a cookie can be stored for months if not years (Users can clear cookies though).

  - Browsers typically limit cookies to a maximum size of around **4KB** per domain.

Jade [#]_
-----------

Jade is an elegant **templating engine**, primarily used for server-side templating in Nodejs. In plain words, Jade gives you a powerful new way to write markup, with a number of advantages over plain HTML.

Summary
--------

I use these module in Nodejs to build the Note-taking system project. I try to use express-generator module because I want to learn about the concept of MVC(Model-View-Controller). MVC separates every module clearly , this may help me to maintain this system easily and efficiently in the future.
