=============================

Introduction
--------------

GitHub Pages provides every github user hosts directly from his GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and the changes are live.

Tutorial
-----------

Step 1. Create a repository
``````````````````````````````

Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named *username*.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

Note : If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

Step 2. Clone the repository
``````````````````````````````

Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

  $ git clone https://github.com/*username*/*username*.github.io

Step 3. Create an index.html and push it
``````````````````````````````````````````

Enter the project folder and add an index.html file. Then add, commit, and push your changes:

  $ git add --all
  $ git commit -m "Hello world"
  $ git push -u origin master
